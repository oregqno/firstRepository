Bunch of random basic scripts made for fun. Most are under 100 lines of code, just to kind of understand the github interface.
If anything doesn't work then feel free to work off of it, as these are more of just practice coding projects
Also: on the naming of the files, I accidentally wrote .gitignore thinking it was a header for the 
gitignore file I added, but turns out it's for all the files in the repository and I don't know how to change it.
